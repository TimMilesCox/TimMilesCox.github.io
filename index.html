<h1>1. The RTA1 Processor Programmable Architecture Specification</h1>

<p>
RTA1 is a freeware computer processor programmable architecture which has run
in emulation on a Unix host computer since January 2012

<p>
Scalability is claimed for the RTA1 architecture. It can run simple dedicated
microcontroller applications in a few dozen words of storage, and it can run
as a major system maintaining some millions of TCP connections simultaneously

<p>
RTA1 is intended to work very fast without having operand cache.
The large array of scratch registers is organised as an internal stack.
No circuitry is needed for cache coherency. SMP scalability is at low cost.
RTA1 and the smaragd7 kernel are SMP capable from the start

<p>
The emulated prototype runs an IP stack connected to real networks and
communicates with other computers via Telnet, SNMP, and HTTP.
A floating-point server application runs over UDP
to demonstrate the range of the RTA1 96-bit floating architecture

<p>
RTA1 is a 24-bit word-addressing architecture with 24- 48- and 96-bit arithmetic.<br>
For unusual requirements RTA1 can calculate 192-bit floating values


<p>
Excellent code density is claimed for RTA1. The emulated prototype runs
IP, UDP and TCP in 3250 instructions. One instruction takes one storage location.
Another 4000 instructions run Telnet, MIB-II + snmpv1, HTTP server,
plus the online floating point server program
