<h1>The RTA1 Processor Programmable Architecture Specification</h1>

<p>
RTA1 is a freeware computer processor programmable architecture which has run
in emulation on a Unix host computer since January 2012

<p>
Scalability is claimed for the RTA1 architecture. It can run simple dedicated
microcontroller applications in a few dozen words of storage, and it can run
as a major system maintaining some millions of TCP connections simultaneously

<p>
RTA1 is also designed from the start for symmetric multiprocessing,
a second plane of scalability

<p>
The emulated prototype is interfaced to Internet Protocol networks and
communicates with other computers with the Telnet, SNMP, HTTP and ICMP-Echo
(Ping) protocols. A floating-point server application also runs over UDP
to demonstrate the power and range of the RTA1 96-bit floating architecture

<p>
RTA1 is a 24-bit word-addressing architecture with 24- 48- and 96-bit arithmetic

<p>
Excellent code density is claimed for RTA1. The emulated prototype runs
IP, UDP and TCP in 3000 instructions which each take one storage location.

<p>
Another 4000 instructions run Telnet, MIB-II + snmpv1, a simple HTTP server,
and an online floating point server program

<p>
RTA1 is intended to work very fast without having operand cache

<p>
The large array of scratch registers is organised as an internal stack

<p>
RTA1 SMP scalability has a vast lateral dimension, without expensive
electronic co-ordination. The internal stack minimises storage reads
and writes without any operand cache

<h1>masmx.7r2 Target Independent Meta Assembler</h1>

<p>
masmx.7r2 is a target-indendent meta-assembler for any target

<p>
It is used by writing a file of macro code for defining the
target architecture and including that in your source or in
a wrapper which also includes your source

<p>
masmx.7r2 runs from shell commmand lines

<p>
masmx.7r2 macro language can understand source code syntaxes meant
for other assemblers. This means masmx.7r2 can assemble any code
unchanged
