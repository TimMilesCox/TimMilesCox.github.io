<h2>1: What are the Machine-Code Emulators?</h2>

<p>
RTA1 is a project aimed at low-power semiconductor, a freeware programmable processor architecture introduced in emulation on PCs

<p>
Emulators run on personal computers for evaluation and RTA1 target software development

<p>
RTA1 emulators are now SMP using core threads available on the platform. Nearly all are in Intel machine code.<br>
Thanks to Intel's icc compiler the remaining emulators derived from the C code-base are also rapid and cool-running

<p>
These new efficient emulations are closer to the RTA1 project's performance objectives for future semiconductor RTA1s

<p>
And certainly more suitable for a project about low power

<p>
The new emulators are twice as fast and the platforms work half as much

<p>
Newer emulators execute RTA1 instructions in a tight loop of platform machine-code

<p>
The result is double the performance of earlier RTA1 emulators and half the demand on platforms

<p>
These faster and cooler emulators are initially delivered for Intel and macOS 64-bit and 32-Bit platforms

<p>
RTA1 project isn't about emulators, but efficiency is suitable for a project about performance from low power 

<p>
The density and efficiency of RTA1 target instruction code is extraordinary. Few instructions are issued to get work done

<p>
TCP / UDP / IP are implemented in 4000 instructions

<p>
Instructions are simple yet RTA1 has the largest floating-point number capability in the world

<p>
Floating point in  RTA1 emulator does not mean the floating capability of the emulator platform

<p>
RTA1 has giant numeric capability unknown to workstations or even to prestige national computers

<p>
Emulated implementations run networked applications in continuous server mode and only ever stop for software upgrades or faster emulators in years of running

<p>
The free download includes emulated machine, network interfacing, target software, and PC-based development and client softare

<p>
The aim of RTA1 is large capability for very little energy. Like when you leave stuff running off a watch battery for a year or more

<h2>2: Where are the New Emulators and how do you have Them?</h2>

New fast emulators for 64-bit Intel Linux are run with script tgen.smp/xra

<p>
New fast emulators for 64-bit macOS Intel are run with script tgen.smp/r

<p>
New fast emulators for 32-bit Intel for Linux and macOS are run with script tgen.smp/ra

<p>
One shell has script runL executing in directory { rta/{ linux.net |  linuxnet.x64 | portal[.x64] }. That trunks network traffic between RTA1 and the world

<p>
Another shell for the emulated machine should be in directory rta/tgen.smp

<p>
Script tgen.smp/{ra|xra|r} starts an emulator in platform machine code

<p>
You need a third shell in rta/client to start routing to RTA1 with script ./prun

<p>
That routes to the RTA1 you just launched and any more RTA1s in your network

<p>
For more detail see <a href="connect.html#run">Starting the Emulator</a>

<a	name="available"/>
<h2>3: RTA1 Emulators Delivered by Platform</h2>

<a	name="need"/>
<h3>3.1: Things you need</h3>

<p>
Note that RTA1 and fponline do just in time assemblies and won't run without <a href="http://timmilescox.github.io/masmx">masmx 7r3A</a>

<a	name="clock"/>
<h3>3.2: 32-Bit and Clock-Wraparound-Year</h3>
Note that 32-bit emulators have a fix for future clock-wraparound, but this will only work if the clock is allowed to wrap around

<p>
Some platforms police the clock to jam at the start of wraparound-year

<a	name="delivered"/>
<h3>3.3: Delivered Emulators</h3>
Note 64-bit Linux platforms may need a 32-bit runtime download

<pre	style="font-size:12pt">

	The numbers on the end of emulator names are
	how many 262144-word blocks of excutable space an emulator has

	bash loads the emulator of size corresponding to $RTA_MBANKS

	all emulators pass the same benchmarks

	the largest emulators use a lot of PC virtual space, but don't use very much of it at once

	For each platform the network service process is mentioned first
	as a reminder that it must start before the emulator.

	If the emulator is restarted -R option at the emulator

		 ./ra -R

	will message the network service to resynchronise the trunk

	The emulators, network interfacers, PC and client programs are
