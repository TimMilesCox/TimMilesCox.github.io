<h3>1: Purpose</h3>


RTA1 high-volume TCP supports one half million to one million connections at each of multiple endpoints

<p>
One million connections per endpoint has been operated without problem. Currently performance is more optimal at one half million connections per endpoint

<p>
The purpose of RTA1 high-volume TCP is to connect large numbers of remote users to their data over request / response  sessions modelled directly onto TCP connections

<p>
TCP is suitable for this purpose because its persistence at delivery does not require additional delivery assurance as connectionless transmission does

<p>
RTA1 success at constructing TCP for millions of simultaneous connections provides an alternative to threaded protocols. TCP is very widely known and understood and requires minimal state variables per dialogue

<p>
Remote users are advised of a TCP port number designated to serve them. Users may be equipped with accompanying encryption data or software on an electronic medium. 

<p>
Application threads serving a population of remote users defined with a range of TCP ports also bind to those remote users' data

Each of eight endpoints here concentrates up to 500 connections on each of up to 2000 TCP ports

<p>
Each application thread receives traffic over a rotating selection in its range of TCP ports

<p>
Application receive threads are event-activated and process all available traffic before resuming event wait

<a	name="api"/>
<h3>2: API</h3>
High volume API is different from the POSIX-like handle-based network API which is also present

<p>
No application has millions of handles

<p>
High-volume API uses thousands-capable port selection plus a dynamic two-part handle { PORT_NUMBER.CONNECTION_IDENTIFIER }

</pre>
Connection identifier is a wild card on read request { PORT : 0 }

<p>
The result of a read has two parts, { BYTES_OBTAINED : CONNECTION_IDENTIFIER }

<p>
Read result { 0 : 0 } means there is no remaining payload on the port. If more arrives the port will select again

<p>

Applications making active connections over high volume ports call __connect() function in the socket low_level api. They treat the port number as bound and available and do not attempt to bind to it.

<p>
Listening Applications do not manage connections in TCP high volume environment. An application may close a connection for any reason

</pre>
</a>

Test traffic for millions of simultaneous TCP connections is obtained from another RTA1

<p>
Some thousands of simultaneous connections are tested from PCs, but testing in this way for millions of connections would need thousands of networks and computers.

<p>
Larger scale testing uses a second RTA1 on the same emulator platform as the listening RTA1. They are connected with a common interface buffer which RTA1 documentation calls a trunk. Trunks also connect emulated RTA1 to WiFi, Ethernet and the software loopback of the platform

<a name="high64"/>
<h4	style="color:#000000">3.1: Highest Performance and Connections Capacity</h4>

<p>
The highest measured performance of an RTA1 emulator is on a Linux 64-bit Pentium Gold platform delivering up to 35'700 responses per second per endpoint thread serving one half million simultaneous connections

<p>
This measurement is obtained with two platform core threads driving two RTA1 cores

<p>
One RTA1 core is mostly occupied driving TCP / IP and the other is mostly occupied with an application receive / respond thread

<p>
A half million remote users request at once and all have a response routed to them
[interface receive -> interface q2 transmission] within 14 seconds

<p>
Potential performance with 8+ platform core threads is over 200'000 reponses per second among 4'000'000 simultaneous connections. This is 20 seconds turnaround for 4'000'000 simultaneous requests

<p>
Observed performance using two platform core threads is 25'000 responses per second among 4'000'000 simultaneous connections, with TCP / IP activity constant, and eight application software threads effectively sharing one platform core thread. This is 160 seconds of turnaround for 4'000'000 simultaneous requests, showing the advantage of upscaling with more cores

<p>
All these figures suppose that each connected remote user transmits a request at once and they all send a new request as soon as they have a response. Requestors which are machines might do that, or may even have sent multiple requests

<p>
Remote users interacting with responses cannot request more often than total response time, which is responding system turnaround time + network time

<p>
A second RTA1 emulation on the same platform employs one core thread and generates connections and test traffic. This second RTA1 is doing the work of up to eight million remote users

<p>
RTA1 emulated cores do not hold platform core threads exclusively but release them when not 100% loaded

<a	name="high32"/>
<h4	style="color:#000000">3.2: Performance and Capacity on 32-Bit Emulator Platforms</h4

The largest capacity RTA1 emulator on 32-bit macOS responds at socket layer to requests on one million TCP connections in 38 seconds, so 26'315 responses per second in two-core configuration

<p>
RTA1 on 32-bit Linux has capacity for a half million connections and can respond on all of them in 14 seconds in two-core configuration

<h4	style="color:#000000">4:1 Shared Network Trunk RTA1 / RTA1</h4> 

<a	name="hvtrafic"/>
The trunk between the two emulated RTA1s is made available with inert process lif which is called with script note.txt in directory rta/hvtrafic

<p>
This shared trunk is interface(5) on both the listening and the driving RTA1


<p>
note.txt replies with a device identifier of the new trunk and that must go on the command lines which start the RTA1 two emulations

The RTA1 / RTA1 trunk process is obtained from the path $RTA_BINARY and may be 32-bit or 64-bit irrespective of which RTA1 emulators are run

<p>
On Linux it may be possible to obtain a network trunk of 16 banks instead of four banks

Routing needs to be set with script aprun once per platform start for this new RTA1

<p>
The driving RTA1 has the address 172.29.7.5 on its interface(2) linked to platform loopback

<p>
Command <a style="color:#000000">stay</a> tells RTA1 not to time the connection out

<p>
Command <a style="color:#000000">ifswap</a> mirrors access to the shared network trunk interface(5) so that each RTA1 receives traffic which the other sends

<p>
Application <a style="color:#000000">proton</a> is commanded to connect, in this example, one million connections

<p>
Command <a style="color:#000000">+</a> connects outwards on a range of ports. 500 connections per port are commanded here. See also <a href="#tuning">Configuration and Tuning</a>

Application proton at RTA1 host 172.29.7.5 displays a digital barometer of outgoing connections. If the barometer pauses incrementing momentarily that assures that interaction and connections are happening

<p>
If very long pauses happen very often during outgoing connections, a command <a style="color:#000000">^</a> before command <a style="color:#000000">+</a> can be used to change the default chill 10ms every 500 outgoing SYN to a different interval in order to keep progress reporting more evenly

but do not repeat the connections command <a style="color:#000000">+</a> without first closing all with command <a style="color:#000000">&lt;</a> unless twice so many connections are intended

<p>
If proton reports that some connections are ESTABLISHED and some are SYNSENT this means SYN_ACK segments are still returning from the listening RTA1. The enquiry command <a style="color:#000000">!</a> informs status * connections

<pre	 style="font-size:12pt;color:#000000">

</pre>
If all the connections remain at SYNSENT then something did not happen. Stop both RTA1s with commmand two periods .. Restart the <a href="#tp1">hvtrafic</a> network with command <a style="color:#000000">r</a>. Start the listening RTA1. Both RTA1 emulators need option <a style="color:#000000">-R</a> to restart their interface(2) to the operator shell

<p>
When prompt <a style="color:#FF0000">proton></a> returns requests can be sent on all connections at once, up to a million on 32-bit platforms and up to four or eight millions on 64-bit platforms

<p>
Send messages command is character <a style="color:#000000">&gt;</a> followed by space, then how many times to repeat for example <a style="color:#000000">1</a>, then message text. The sample message goes on each connection in turn, then all again if repeat > 1

<h3>5: Configuration and Tuning</h3>

A range of high-volume ports is assigned by a clause immediately following any network address in any interface declaration in platform file $HOME/.rta_net or for a second RTA1 $HOME/.arta_net, for example

<p>
export RTA_WIFI=172.29.7.12/26+172.29.7.14/26@192.168.1.0/24+10.0.0.5/8:<a style="color:#FF0000">10240/tcp/16384/501</a>@172.29.7.0/26

<p>
The first subclause is the starting port number in the range and the third part is the number of ports. The last part is the maximum connections per port which is recommended not to exceed 500 + 1. One extra connection is used for traffic concentration

<p>
The larger inputs and outputs expected per connection, the less the maximum number of connections per port should be

<p>
An approximate guide is maximum_connections_per_port = 120000 / (average_output_message_in_bytes + 80) / 2

<p>
This formula allows for many segment transmissions which maintain TCP flow control and carry no payload, and for the requirement in TCP to keep transmitted payload until it is acknowledged 

<p>
Although high volume port assigments are appended to interface and address declarations, high volume ports and traffic are not bound to any address or interface and their declaration does not influence routing on transmission or which interfaces receive traffic for any port

<h3>6: Memory reserved at Startup</h3>

If many TCP ports are assigned for high-volume traffic and an emulator with small memory is started for example
<pre>

	export	TCP_MBANKS=2

</pre>
then some initial server threads [ telnet fponline snmp http i_server ] may not run or new threads may not run

<p>
Start-up configuration assigns a 4096-word page of storage per 512 high-volume TCP ports and may exhaust free memory if a high-volume TCP configuration in .rta_net has been overlooked

<p>
Each High-Volume TCP port acquires a 262144-word block of storage when connections start to be added
