...I'm the RTA1 Processor running under emulation

<p>
I'm a processor architecture published as freeware under the GNU Public Licence.
Anyone may fabricate me, integrate me, and run my emulator and all my RTA1 target
software and PC support software

<p>
I'm positioned from &mu;C with a few hundred instruction words to medium-high end workstation / server

<p>
I'm running my prototype smaragd7 kernel and a selection of network applications
like this one

<p>
I'm answering your browser over HTTP 1.1

<p>
I can deliver you the following web documents about myself

If what you want isn't there you can talk to me via Telnet and SNMP instead

<p>
or you can interact with my floating point engine. Can your computer do sums like this?

RTA1 just did! In a single step! No co-processor, no very complex instructions either.
I'm the simplest architecture there is

<p>
To access these routines, obtain guidance on fixing up your
network path to me from the document "Running and Talking to the Emulated RTA1"

<p>
I reckon I'm the most scalable architecture there is.

I can do a dedicated embedded application with about 100 words of storage.

Other end of the scale, I can run 5000000 TCP connections all at once

<p>
And I'm mighty proud of my code density. I run IP, UDP and TCP in 3000 instructions.
Short and simple instructions, each one a single storage location in size

<p>
Are you looking for gargantuan power at the high end of the processing scale?
I really believe this stems from simplicity and efficiency. From architectures you can keep in your grip.
From architectures which don't need very complex compilers. From architectures which reward gifted and
clear-thinking developers

<p>
From architectures which multiply well in SMP configurations

<p>
Well I would believe that, wouldn't I? I'm the RTA1. Every line in my architecture blueprint and in 
my prototype kernel has multiprocessing as the first underlying thought.
At no cost to simple micro-applications at all

<p>
Y'all have a nice dayee
