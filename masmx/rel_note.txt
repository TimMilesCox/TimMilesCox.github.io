Preliminary	masmx.7r3A	Build 3	Distribution 15 June 2018
___________	__________	_______	_________________________




	masmx.7r3A revises and makes more consistent
	the assembly of hierarchically structured and
	named code and data

	added -H option, allows unrounded floating constants<br><br>

	addition of :z suffix on number constants for 7-word constants<br>
	size-suffixes may be used to position floating exponent field in label-equated values<br>
	in addition to overriding self-sizing in integers<br><br>

	Earlier application code needs no changes

Product Components
__________________


All the binaries delivered are standalone programs.

	masmx is the assembler with all features

	masmz is the assembler with a subset of features

masmx.7r3a manual describes masmx command line

	imx converts the output of masmx and masmz to 16-bit address I-Records

		imx	file.txo irec_file

	mmx converts the output of masmx and masmz to 32-bit address S-Records

		mmx	file.txo srec_file

	symbol extracts exported names from assembled programs
	so that the names may be captured as environmental variables

		symbol	< file.txo [export|set] [all] > capture[.bat]
		source	capture

	one word like export or set may be output in front of each
	extracted label. The keyword

		all

	causes externalised names of storage locations to be extracted.
	By default symbol only extracts symbols which are not addresses.
	Values are output in decimal

masmx contains all the features described in the manual

The masmx features absent from masmz are hierarchical data structure
and runtime algorithm plotter

The directives $TREE $BRANCH $ROOT $RECORD $XQT_I $XQT_FP
are therefore absent from masmz.
